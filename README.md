# FO2_INTRFACE_EDITOR

FOnline2 S3 Interface Editor is 3rd party program 
not released by original game developers.
A way to edit interface through linking interface features 
& OpenGL rendered interface components.

![alt text](/misc/FO2InterfaceEditor?raw=true "FO2InterfaceEditor")

Designed primarily for FOnline2 S3 although it can be adapted to other
FOnline servers (variations).

Editor itself modifies only the .ini of the interface
and is not an image editor itself.

Images are rendered through JOGL (Java OpenGL) library.

Although it can be inaccurate on some regions (also called sections).
Users are highly encouraged to test their interfaces in the game (client).
